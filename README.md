# ShoppingList
A table view that you can add new itens.
On this project I created a table view and the user can add and remove itens for their shopping list. There's a right bar button where the user can tap and it pops an Alert Controller with text field to write the name of the item. 
If the user swipes the row to the left, they can delete that item. If the user taps on the item it shows a check mark on the selected cell. 
I used User Defaults to save the list, so it doesn't desappear when the app is closed.
